This was our first styling project. We were given an unstyled HTML file and had to style it to match a mockup. The mockup can be found here: https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/893e7a89-octocats.jpg

With this project, I played with the layout of multiple images and lines of text. At first I was a little intimidated and had no idea where to begin. I started with shrinking the images and adding a background color to each class. This helped me manipulate the content more easily. I am now a little more confident in my CSS abilities. Previously I was having trouble with padding and margin, but I feel that I understand it a lot better after this project. I also learned a little bit about pseudo elements; I am still a little fuzzy on them, but it was a nice intro to the concept.
